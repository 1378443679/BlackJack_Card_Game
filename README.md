🃏 Terminal Blackjack Game (Python)
This is a simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. It simulates a game between a player and a dealer, using basic rules and random card dealing. Great for beginners looking to learn control flow, user input, and randomization in Python!

🎮 How to Play
The game starts by dealing 2 random cards to both the player and the dealer.

You (the player) will be shown your cards and asked if you want to:

Hit (1): Draw another card.

Stay (0): Keep your current hand.

You can hit up to 3 times (for a total of 5 cards).

After you stay or reach 5 cards, the game will compare your total to the dealer's:

If your total is over 21, you bust and lose.

If both totals are equal, it's a draw.

The higher total under or equal to 21 wins.
